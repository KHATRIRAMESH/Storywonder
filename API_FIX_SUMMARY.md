# API Request Issue Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified
The dashboard was experiencing infinite API requests for `/api/stories` endpoint, causing the application to hang with pending requests.

## 🔧 Root Causes & Fixes

### 1. **useCallback Dependencies Issue**
**Problem**: The `apiCallWithAuth` function in `useApiCall()` was being recreated on every render, causing the `useEffect` in `useApiData` to trigger infinitely.

**Fix**: Added `useCallback` to memoize the function:
```typescript
const apiCallWithAuth = useCallback(async (endpoint, options) => {
  // ... function body
}, [getToken]);
```

### 2. **Unconditional API Calls**
**Problem**: Dashboard was attempting to call `/api/stories` regardless of backend connection status.

**Fix**: Made stories loading conditional on successful backend authentication:
```typescript
const shouldLoadStories = isSignedIn && !authError && !profileError && authStatus;
const { data: stories } = useApiData<Story[]>(shouldLoadStories ? '/api/stories' : '');
```

### 3. **Empty Endpoint Handling**
**Problem**: `useApiData` hook didn't properly handle empty endpoints, causing unnecessary loading states.

**Fix**: Added endpoint validation:
```typescript
if (!endpoint) {
  setLoading(false);
  setError(null);
  setData(null);
  return;
}
```

### 4. **Request Timeout Issues**
**Problem**: Requests could hang indefinitely if backend was unreachable.

**Fix**: Added timeout handling with Promise.race:
```typescript
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timeout')), 10000);
});

const response = await Promise.race([fetch(url, config), timeoutPromise]);
```

### 5. **Better Error Messages**
**Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult.

**Fix**: Added specific error handling for common issues:
```typescript
if (error.message.includes('Failed to fetch')) {
  throw new Error('Unable to connect to backend server. Please ensure it is running on port 8000.');
}
```

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Infinite API requests
- ❌ Pending requests causing app freeze
- ❌ Poor error messaging
- ❌ No request timeouts

### After Fix:
- ✅ Controlled API requests with proper caching
- ✅ Conditional loading based on auth status
- ✅ Clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ 10-second timeout for hanging requests
- ✅ Better UX with loading states

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Backend Running**: Start frontend with backend on port 8000
2. **Backend Down**: Test frontend when backend is offline
3. **Network Issues**: Test with slow/unstable connections
4. **Console Monitoring**: Check browser console for API call logs

## 🔍 Debugging Features Added

- **Request Logging**: All API calls are logged to console
- **Response Status**: HTTP status codes are logged
- **Error Details**: Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Timeout Detection**: Clear indication when requests timeout

## 📝 Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The fixes are backward compatible and work with existing backend integration.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Monitor console logs during development
2. Adjust timeout value if needed (currently 10 seconds)
3. Add retry logic if desired for failed requests
4. Consider implementing request caching for better performance
